The once friendly land of Cornwall was already but a thin gray line, and was dropping fast as Temptress lurched over the waves sent tumbling down theChannel be fore an easterly breeze. It was my departure from England. Settling myself more comfortably at the kicking tiller I sighed and said out loud, Well, Im off once more, and will not turn back this time. Not that I was feeling particularly brave, nor had I yet gained confidence in the boat. Indeed, she had only become mine a few months previously, and this was her first season afloat for ten years. Perhaps it was a bit foolhardy setting off direct for Gibraltar, but it was comforting to know that the French port of Brest could be used as a bolt hole for the next two days if anything alarming hap pened. At least the boat had had a shakedown cruise up Channel from Dartmouth to the Solent and back to Falmouth and Helf ord before setting forth on the ocean. 11 12 SINGLE-HANDED PASSAGE Morale Lad not been improved by the failure of my first attempt to reach Gibraltar the previous winter in the 20-ton cutter Content. Setting forth from Penzance at the end of November, I had waltzed into a series of biting gales. Vari ous gear had carried away, including the metal tiller jaws. This had left me with no means of steering for two and a half days, until repairs could be effected, during which time the loose rudder had worked open a seam in the lower part of the transom and water had poured in. Preferring to risk losing the yacht on a lee shore rather than foundering at sea, course had been set to return to England in a gale of wind with bad visibility. After a total of eight days at sea, the iron bound coast had been picked up shockingly close, but I man aged to scramble into some sort of shelter and anchor near Newlyn, too exhausted to enter harbour, and with the boat rolling ominouslywith tons of water in the bilges. I had had just enough strength to pump out before collapsing on my bunk. Repairs had taken some time in Penzance, the worst place I have ever met for yacht work. The firm, for some obscure reason, in spite of the fact that I had Lloyds millions behind me, insisted on payment before the work could be started, and finally we parted the best of enemies.

10339,Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape,"This New York Times–bestselling exploration of the Arctic, a National Book Award winner, is “one of the finest books ever written about the far North” (Publishers Weekly). “The nation’s premier nature writer” travels to a landscape at once barren and beautiful, perilous and alluring, austere yet teeming with vibrant life, and shot through with human history (San Francisco Chronicle). The Arctic has for centuries been a destination for the most ambitious explorers—a place of dreams, fears, and awe-inspiring spectacle. This “dazzling” account by the author of Of Wolves and Men takes readers on a breathtaking journey into the heart of one of the world’s last frontiers (The New York Times). Based on Barry Lopez’s years spent traveling the Arctic regions in the company of Eskimo hunting parties and scientific expeditions alike, Arctic Dreams investigates the unique terrain of the human mind, thrown into relief against the vastness of the tundra and the frozen ocean. Eye-opening and profoundly moving, it is a magnificent appreciation of how wilderness challenges and inspires us. Renowned environmentalist and author of Desert Solitaire Edward Abbey has called Arctic Dreams “a splendid book . . . by a man who is both a first-rate writer and an uncompromising defender of the wild country and its native inhabitants”—and the New Yorker hails it as a “landmark” work of travel writing. A vivid, thoughtful, and atmospheric read, it has earned multiple prizes, including the National Book Award, the Christopher Medal, the Oregon Book Award, and a nomination for the National Book Critics Circle Award. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Barry Lopez including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author’s personal collection.",Barry Lopez,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y-WxJYMD5HsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2013-06-25,Nature

190821,Nature's Management,"History remembers Edmund Ruffin, the Virginia native believed to have fired the first shot against Fort Sumter in 1861, as one of the South's most aggressive ""fire-eaters."" This volume of Ruffin's work offers us his less known but equally intense passion for agricultural study. In carefully edited selections from Ruffin's writings, Jack Temple Kirby presents an innovative, progressive agronomist and pioneering conservationist. Arranged in sections discussing southern agricultural history, Ruffin's observations of nature, his ideas about land reform, and his plans for soil rejuvenation, Nature’s Management shows that Ruffin was a thinker far ahead of his time, recognizing our need to improve agriculture and to protect nature. Known as the ""father of soil science"" in the United States, Edmund Ruffin discovered and solved the problem of soil acidity while still in his twenties and published several papers on the subject. As the publication of his writing increased, Ruffin left his own farming business to pursue his studies. This volume contains a collection of Ruffin's essays on a variety of interrelated subjects. From the promotion of fencing and methods of malaria prevention to advocacy of a public works program and the recycling of waste, Ruffin's ideas paved the way for the early conservation movement associated with Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot, and others. Nature's Management presents Ruffin's activism and innovative genius at its best, replacing the image of a southern firebrand with that of an outspoken reformer deserving of recognition.",Edmund Ruffin,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K9fDmrHztpcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,University of Georgia Press,2006,Nature

188190,How To Control Your Anxiety Before It Controls You,"Learn to manage your anxiety with this classic self-help book from a respected pioneer of psychotherapy. From social anxiety to phobias to post-traumatic stress disorder, sources of anxiety in daily life are numerous, and can have a powerful impact on your future. By following the rules of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), created by world renowned therapist Dr. Albert Ellis, you can stop anxiety in its tracks if you will admit this important fact: Things and people do not make you anxious. You do. Your unrealistic expectations produce your needless anxiety. Yet not all anxiety is needless . . . Healthy anxiety can ward off dangers and make you aware of negative things that you can change. Unhealthy anxiety inhibits you from enjoying everyday activities and relationships, causes you to perform poorly, and blocks your creativity. Using the easy-to-master, proven precepts of REBT, this classic book not only helps you distinguish between healthy and unhealthy anxiety, but teaches you how to: • Understand and dispute the irrational beliefs that make you anxious • Use a variety of exercises, including rational coping self-statements, reframing, problem-solving methods, and Unconditional Self-Acceptance (USA), to control your anxiety • Apply over two hundred maxims to control your anxious thinking as well as your bodily reactions to anxiety . . . and much more, including examples from dozens of cases Dr. Ellis treated successfully. Now you can overcome the crippling effects of anxiety—and increase your prospects for success, pleasure, and happiness at home and in the workplace. “No individual—not even Freud himself—has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.” —Psychology Today",Albert Ellis,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GiioCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Citadel Press,2016-06-28,Self-Help

41073,A walk across America,"Twenty-five years ago, a disillusioned young man set out on a walk across America. This is the book he wrote about that journey -- a classic account of the reawakening of his faith in himself and his country. ""I started out searching for myself and my country,"" Peter Jenkins writes, ""and found both."" In this timeless classic, Jenkins describes how disillusionment with society in the 1970s drove him out onto the road on a walk across America. His experiences remain as sharp and telling today as they were twenty-five years ago -- from the timeless secrets of life, learned from a mountain-dwelling hermit, to the stir he caused by staying with a black family in North Carolina, to his hours of intense labor in Southern mills. Many, many miles later, he learned lessons about his country and himself that resonate to this day -- and will inspire a new generation to get out, hit the road and explore.",Peter Jenkins,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=puu8bjLca94C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2001-09-18,History

From these pages emerge the fine arts of environmental design, an understanding of the political and economic events that helped to determine settlement in North America, an appreciation of the various architectural and landscape forms that the settlers created, and an awareness of the diversity of the continent's geography and its peoples. Considering the humblest buildings along with the mansions of the wealthy and powerful, public buildings, forts, and churches, Kornwolf captures the true dynamism and diversity of colonial communities - their rivalries and frictions, their outlooks and attitudes - as they extended their hold on the land.",James D.

But whenever I found myself guilty of overstressing the romantic side of the picture and forgetful of the more prosaic life beneath, I tried to balance the scales more properly.

19359,Gold dust,"Rejected by his tribe and hunted by the kin of the man he killed, Ukhayyad and his thoroughbred camel flee across the desolate Tuareg deserts of the Sahara. Between bloody wars against the Italians in the north and famine raging in the south, Ukhayyad rides for the remote rock caves of Jebel Hasawna. There, he says farewell to the mount who has been his companion through thirst, disease, lust, and loneliness. Alone in the desert, haunted by the prophetic cave paintings of ancient hunting scenes and the cries of jinn in the night, Ukhayyad awaits the arrival of his pursuers and their insatiable hunger for blood and gold. Gold Dust is a classic story of the brotherhood between man and beast, the thread of companionship that is all the difference between life and death in the desert. It is a story of the fight to endure in a world of limitless and waterless wastes, and a parable of the struggle to survive in the most dangerous landscape of all: human society.",Ibrahim al-Koni| Ibrāhīm Kūnī,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uCx1rmfx52QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,American Univ in Cairo Press,2008,Fiction

37252,The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece,"The Greeks of the classical age invented not only the central idea of Western politics--that the power of state should be guided by a majority of its citizens--but also the central act of Western warfare, the decisive infantry battle. Instead of ambush, skirmish, maneuver, or combat between individual heroes, the Greeks of the fifth century b.c. devised a ferocious, brief, and destructive head-on clash between armed men of all ages. In this bold, original study, Victor Davis Hanson shows how this brutal enterprise was dedicated to the same outcome as consensual government--an unequivocal, instant resolution to dispute. The Western Way of War draws from an extraordinary range of sources--Greek poetry, drama, and vase painting, as well as historical records--to describe what actually took place on the battlefield. It is the first study to explore the actual mechanics of classical Greek battle from the vantage point of the infantryman--the brutal spear-thrusting, the difficulty of fighting in heavy bronze armor which made it hard to see, hear and move, and the fear. Hanson also discusses the physical condition and age of the men, weaponry, wounds, and morale. This compelling account of what happened on the killing fields of the ancient Greeks ultimately shows that their style of armament and battle was contrived to minimize time and life lost by making the battle experience as decisive and appalling as possible. Linking this new style of fighting to the rise of constitutional government, Hanson raises new issues and questions old assumptions about the history of war.",Victor Davis Hanson,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lAWEPUkz5sIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Knopf,2013-05-01,History

110098,Forced Justice : School Desegregation and the Law,"School desegregation and ""forced"" busing first brought people to the barricades during the 1960s and 1970s, and the idea continues to spark controversy today whenever it is proposed. A quiet rage smolders in hundreds of public school systems, where court- ordered busing plans have been in place for over twenty years. Intended to remedy the social and educational disadvantages of minorities, desegregation policy has not produced any appreciable educational gains, while its political and social costs have been considerable. Now, on the fortieth anniversary of the Supreme Court's epic decision, Brown v. Board of Education, the legal and social justifications for school desegregation are ripe for reexamination. In Forced Justice, David J. Armor explores the benefits and drawbacks of voluntary and involuntary desegregation plans, especially those in communities with ""magnet"" schools. He finds that voluntary plans, which let parents decide which school program is best for their children, are just as effective in attaining long-term desegregation as mandatory busing, and that these plans generate far greater community support. Armor concludes by proposing a new policy of ""equity"" choice, which draws upon the best features of both the desegregation and choice movements. This policy promises both improved desegregation and greater educational choices for all, especially for the disadvantaged minority children in urban systems who now have the fewest educational choices. The debate over desegregation policy and its many consequences needs to move beyond academic journals and courtrooms to a larger audience. In addition to educators and policymakers, Forced Justice will be an important book for social scientists, attorneys and specialists in civil rights issues, and all persons concerned about the state of public education.",David J.

60055,The Puerto Rican Nation on the Move: Identities on the Island and in the United States,"Puerto Ricans maintain a vibrant identity that bridges two very different places--the island of Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland. Whether they live on the island, in the States, or divide time between the two, most imagine Puerto Rico as a separate nation and view themselves primarily as Puerto Rican. At the same time, Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and Puerto Rico has been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Jorge Duany uses previously untapped primary sources to bring new insights to questions of Puerto Rican identity, nationalism, and migration. Drawing a distinction between political and cultural nationalism, Duany argues that the Puerto Rican ""nation"" must be understood as a new kind of translocal entity with deep cultural continuities. He documents a strong sharing of culture between island and mainland, with diasporic communities tightly linked to island life by a steady circular migration. Duany explores the Puerto Rican sense of nationhood by looking at cultural representations produced by Puerto Ricans and considering how others--American anthropologists, photographers, and museum curators, for example--have represented the nation. His sources of information include ethnographic fieldwork, archival research, interviews, surveys, censuses, newspaper articles, personal documents, and literary texts.",Jorge Duany,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8jzqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Univ of North Carolina Press,2003-10-15,History

This will become a required handbook for any organization implementing SOA."" —Dan Bertrand, Enterprise Technology Officer & EDS Fellow, EDS Corporation ""A fundamental breakthrough in the business and technology perspectives of SOA-this book belongs in every software developer, architect, and IT executive library.

88518,The Red Queen. Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature.,"Sex is as fascinating to scientists as it is to the rest of us. A vast pool of knowledge, therefore, has been gleaned from research into the nature of sex, from the contentious problem of why the wasteful reproductive process exists at all, to how individuals choose their mates and what traits they find attractive. This fascinating book explores those findings, and their implications for the sexual behaviour of our own species. It uses the Red Queen from ‘Alice in Wonderland’ – who has to run at full speed to stay where she is – as a metaphor for a whole range of sexual behaviours. The book was shortlisted for the 1994 Rhone-Poulenc Prize for Science Books. ‘Animals and plants evolved sex to fend off parasitic infection. Now look where it has got us. Men want BMWs, power and money in order to pair-bond with women who are blonde, youthful and narrow-waisted ... a brilliant examination of the scientific debates on the hows and whys of sex and evolution’ Independent.",Matt Ridley,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CWza0RyG_MwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Penguin UK,1994-10-06,Psychology

71847,The Augustan Aristocracy,"While the monarchy established by Caesar Augustus attracts assiduous study, not enough has been said about the old nobility renascent after years of civil war. One clear reason is the nature of the evidence, most of it sporadic or recondite. To be made intelligible, the theme demands constantrecourse to better documented periods. The exposition has to range backward to the closing age of the Republic and forward to Nero's death. In fact, the best testimony to the Augustan aristocracy derives from the Annals of Tacitus. After splendour and success, evident notably in the second decade ofthe reign (on which this book is centred), the ancient houses went down in the embrace of the dynasty, itself from the outset an aristocratic nexus. Covering something like a century and a half in the history of Roman families, this book may be taken as a supplement no less than sequel to The RomanRevolution (OUP 1939) and to Tacitus (OUP 1958).",Ronald Syme,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fj8oQ4lzteIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,1989,History

She is best known for her fearless reporting in Europe before and during WWII and for her brief marriage to Ernest Hemingway, but she was also an acclaimed novelist. In 1938, before the Munich pact, Gellhorn visited Prague and witnessed its transformation from a proud democracy preparing to battle Hitler to a country occupied by the German army. Born out of this experience, A Stricken Field follows a journalist who returns to Prague after its annexation and finds her efforts to obtain help for the refugees and to convey the shocking state of the country both frustrating and futile. A convincing account of a people under the brutal oppression of the Gestapo, A Stricken Field is Gellhorn’s most powerful work of fiction. “[A] brave, final novel. Its writing is quick with movement and with sympathy; its people alive with death, if one can put it that way.

977,Legends of the Iroquois (Myths and Legends),"THESE 24 Iroquois legends and stories have been told in the homes of the Iroquois for many centuries; long before the white man arrived on the North American continent. The perusal and study of these stories will, it is believed, give as much pleasure to the reader, as they have given the compiler. Of special interest is the “Legend of Hiawatha” made famous fifty years earlier by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Some of the stories and lengends in this volume are: The Birth of the Arbutus A Legend Of The River Legends Of The Corn The First Winter The Great Mosquito The Story Of Oniata The Legends of Hiawatha, and many, many more. The American Indians, like so many cultures, built neither monuments nor wrote books. However, they did make picture writings, known in later years as “wampum.” Mostly, these were mere symbols, recording mainly feats of arms. However, the Iroquois used wampum as a record of a person’s credentials or a certificate of authority. It was also used for official purposes and religious ceremonies, and it was used as a way to bind peace between tribes. Among the Iroquois, every chief and every clan mother has a certain string of wampum that serves as their certificate of office. When they pass on or are removed from their station, the string will then pass on to the new leader.

145325,General Introduction To Psychoanalysis,"Psychoanalysis was never just a method of treatment, rather a vision of the human condition which has continued to fascinate and provoke long after the death of its originator. Its central hypothesis, that we live in conflict with ourselves and seek to resolve matters by turning away from reality, did not emerge from experimental science but from self-examination and the unique opportunities for observation presented by the psychoanalytic technique - in particular, from the confessions produced by ‘free-association’ in Freud’s consulting room. Written during the turmoil of the First World War, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis was distilled from a series of lectures given at Vienna University, but had to wait for the war to end before being made available to the English speaking world.",Sigmund Freud,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qLm6DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"Lulu Press, Inc",2016-07-16,Social Science

Desperate to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult that worships the shadowless. As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the cure.

The shipwrecked fortunes of the Csillag family suddenly take a new and marvelous turn. The golden watch brings an unexpected gift to the future generations of firstborn sons: clairvoyance. Passed down from father to son, this gift offers the ability to look into the future or back into history–for some it is considered a blessing, for others a curse. No matter the outcome, each generation records its astonishing, vivid, and revelatory visions into a battered journal that becomes known as The Book of Fathers.

26194,The Shortest Shadow: Nietzsche's Philosophy of the Two (Short Circuits),"Restoring Nietzsche to a Nietzschean context—examining the definitive element that animates his work. What is it that makes Nietzsche Nietzsche? In The Shortest Shadow, Alenka Zupančič counters the currently fashionable appropriation of Nietzsche as a philosopher who was ""ahead of his time"" but whose time has finally come—the rather patronizing reduction of his often extraordinary statements to mere opinions that we can ""share."" Zupančič argues that the definitive Nietzschean quality is his very unfashionableness, his being out of the mainstream of his or any time. To restore Nietzsche to a context in which the thought ""lives on its own credit,"" Zupančič examines two aspects of his philosophy. First, in ""Nietzsche as Metapsychologist,"" she revisits the principal Nietzschean themes—his declaration of the death of God (which had a twofold meaning, ""God is dead"" and ""Christianity survived the death of God""), the ascetic ideal, and nihilism—as ideas that are very much present in our hedonist postmodern condition. Then, in the second part of the book, she considers Nietzsche's figure of the Noon and its consequences for his notion of the truth. Nietzsche describes the Noon not as the moment when all shadows disappear but as the moment of ""the shortest shadow""—not the unity of all things embraced by the sun, but the moment of splitting, when ""one turns into two."" Zupančič argues that this notion of the Two as the minimal and irreducible difference within the same animates all of Nietzsche's work, generating its permanent and inherent tension.",Alenka Zupancic,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lL9NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,MIT Press,2003-09-26,Philosophy

103346,Catfish at the pump: Humor and the frontier,"Were our forefathers liars? ""You bet they were,"" says Roger Welsch, ""and damned fine ones at that."" The proof is in Catfish at the Pump, a collection of the kind of humor that softened the hardships of pioneering on the Great Plains. From yellowed newspapers, magazines, and forgotten Nebraska Federal Writers' Project files, the well-known folklorist and humorist Roger Welsch has produced a book to be treasured. Here are jokes, anecdotes, legends, tall tales, and lugubriously funny poems about the things that preoccupied the pioneer plainsman: weather extremes; soil quality; food and whiskey; an arkload of animals, including grasshoppers, bed bugs, hoop snakes, the ubiquitous mule, and some mighty big fish; and even sickness and the poverty that would inspire black laughter again in the Great Depression. Catfish at the Pump proves abundantly that the art of story telling was practiced diligently by our plains ancestors. Roger Welsch, who brought out Shingling the Fog and Other Plains Lies in 1972 (reprinted by the University of Nebraska Press in 1980), now issues this ""book about lies and liars,"" knowing full well that ""underlying the pioneer sense of humor is a profound respect for truth.""",Roger L.

196994,A book of myths,"Those who are interested in watching the mental development of a child must have noted that when the baby has learned to speak even a little, it begins to show its growing intelligence by asking questions. ""What is this?"" it would seem at first to ask with regard to simple things that to it are still mysteries. Soon it arrives at the more far-reaching inquiries-""Why is this so?"" ""How did this happen?"" And as the child's mental growth continues, the painstaking and conscientious parent or guardian is many times faced by questions which lack of knowledge, or a sensitive honesty, prevents him from answering either with assurance or with ingenuity. As with the child, so it has ever been with the human race. Man has always come into the world asking ""How?"" ""Why?"" ""What?"" and so the Hebrew, the Greek, the Maori, the Australian blackfellow, the Norseman-in a word, each race of mankind-has formed for itself an explanation of existence, an answer to the questions of the groping child-mind-""Who made the world?"" ""What is God?"" ""What made a God think of fire and air and water?"" ""Why am I, I?""

8300,Blessing Same-Sex Unions: The Perils of Queer Romance and the Confusions of Christian Marriage,"At most church weddings, the person presiding over the ritual is not a priest or a pastor, but the wedding planner, followed by the photographer, the florist, and the caterer. And in this day and age, more wedding theology is supplied by Modern Bride magazine or reality television than by any of the Christian treatises on holy matrimony. Indeed, church weddings have strayed long and far from distinctly Christian aspirations. The costumes and gestures might still be right, but the intentions are hardly religious. Why then, asks noted gay commentator Mark D. Jordan, are so many churches vehemently opposed to blessing same-sex unions? In this incisive work, Jordan shows how carefully selected ideals of Christian marriage have come to dominate recent debates over same-sex unions. Opponents of gay marriage, he reveals, too often confuse simplified ideals of matrimony with historical facts. They suppose, for instance, that there has been a stable Christian tradition of marriage across millennia, when in reality Christians have quarreled among themselves for centuries about even the most basic elements of marital theology, authorizing experiments like polygamy and divorce. Jordan also argues that no matter what the courts do, Christian churches will have to decide for themselves whether to bless same-sex unions. No civil compromise can settle the religious questions surrounding gay marriage. And queer Christians, he contends, will have to discover for themselves what they really want out of marriage. If they are not just after legal recognition as a couple or a place at the social table, do they really seek the blessing of God? Or just the garish melodrama of a white wedding? Posing trenchant questions such as these, Blessing Same-Sex Unions will be a must-read for both sides of the debate over gay marriage in America today.",Mark D.

200916,"The birth of a new physics (Science study series, S10)","This book investigates, through the problem of the earth's shape, part of the development of post-Newtonian mechanics by the Parisian scientific community during the first half of the eighteenth century. In the Principia Newton first raised the question of the earth's shape. John Greenberg shows how continental scholars outside France influenced efforts in Paris to solve the problem, and he also demonstrates that Parisian scholars, including Bouguer and Fontaine, did work that Alexis-Claude Clairaut used in developing his mature theory of the earth's shape. The evolution of Parisian mechanics proved not to be the replacement of a Cartesian paradigm by a Newtonian one, a replacement that might be expected from Thomas Kuhn's formulations about scientific revolutions, but a complex process instead involving many areas of research and contributions of different kinds from the entire scientific world. Greenberg both explores the myriad of technical problems that underlie the historical development of part of post-Newtonian mechanics, which have only been rarely analyzed by Western scholars, and embeds his technical discussion in a framework that involves social and institutional history politics, and biography. Instead of focusing exclusively on the historiographical problem, Greenberg shows as well that international scientific communication was as much a vital part of the scientific progress of individual nations during the first half of the eighteenth century as it is today.",John L.

67831,A World of Our Own,"Tracing the history of intercultural struggle and cooperation in the citrus belt of Greater Los Angeles, Matt Garcia explores the social and cultural forces that helped make the city the expansive and diverse metropolis that it is today. As the citrus-growing regions of the San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys in eastern Los Angeles County expanded during the early twentieth century, the agricultural industry there developed along segregated lines, primarily between white landowners and Mexican and Asian laborers. Initially, these communities were sharply divided. But Los Angeles, unlike other agricultural regions, saw important opportunities for intercultural exchange develop around the arts and within multiethnic community groups. Whether fostered in such informal settings as dance halls and theaters or in such formal organizations as the Intercultural Council of Claremont or the Southern California Unity Leagues, these interethnic encounters formed the basis for political cooperation to address labor discrimination and solve problems of residential and educational segregation. Though intercultural collaborations were not always successful, Garcia argues that they constitute an important chapter not only in Southern California's social and cultural development but also in the larger history of American race relations.",Matt Garcia,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NELcVmnIiEQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,UNC Press Books,2010-01-27,Social Science
140497,"Paul, the Law, and the Covenant","The now familiar new perspective asserts that the covenantal nomism characteristic of second-temple Judaism softened the Mosaic law s requirement of perfect obedience. Because of God s gracious covenant with Israel, manifested in election and the provision of atoning sacrifices, one could be righteous under the law despite occasional failures to obey the law perfectly. This view concludes that Paul, as a first-century Jew, could not have been troubled by the law s stringent demands, because it was generally understood that the gracious framework of the covenant provided a way of dealing with occasional lapses. Consequently, it is claimed, Paul s problem with the law must have to do with its misuse as a means of enforcing ethnic boundaries and excluding Gentile believers. However, as Das demonstrates in this book, whenever the gracious framework of covenantal nomism is called into question, the law s demands take on central importance. Das traces this development in a number of second-temple Jewish works and especially in the writings of Paul. Covenantal nomism is probably an apt characterization of Paul s opponents, and indeed of Paul s past life; thus he can assert that formerly he was blameless under the law. But now Paul sees God s grace as active only in Christ. He emphatically denies that God will show special grace in his judgment of Jews; to do so would be favoritism. Similarly, Paul sees no atoning benefit to the sacrificial system. In effect, Paul is no longer a covenantal nomist. Since the gracious framework of the covenant has collapsed, all that remains for Paul is the law, with its oppressive requirement of perfect obedience and ethnic exclusivism. Contra the ""newperspective,"" the ""works of the law"" should not be construed so narrowly as only the law's ethnic exclusivity. Christ is ""the end"" of the law in general, both in the sense that he is the goal to which the law always pointed, and in that he is the sole agent of God's grace apart from which the law's demands would be impossible.",A.

First, the various dimensions of the empirical study of the sciences are clarified in a methodological analysis of theoretical traditions, including the sociology of scientific knowledge and neo-conventionalism in the philosophy of science. Second, the author argues why the mathematical theory of communication enables us to address crucial problems in science and technology studies, both on the qualitative side (e.g., the significance of a reconstruction) and on the quantitative side (e.g., the prediction of indicators). A comprehensive set of probabilistic entropy measures for studying complex developments in networks is elaborated. In the third part of the study, applications to S&T policy questions (e.g., the emergence of a European R&D system), to problems of (Bayesian) knowledge representations, and to the study of the sciences in terms of 'self-organizing' paradigms of scientific communication are provided.

69685,Beyond Acting White: Reframing the Debate on Black Student Achievement,"Why do Blacks underperform in school? Researchers continue to pursue this question with vigor not only because Blacks currently lag behind Whites on a wide variety of educational indices but because the closing of the Black-White achievement gap has slowed and by some measures reversed during the last quarter of the 20th century. The social implications of the persistent educational 'gap' between Blacks and Whites are substantial. Black people's experience with poor school achievement and equally poor access to postsecondary education reduces their probability for achieving competitive economic and social rewards and are inconsistent with repeated evidence that Black people articulate high aspirations for their own educational and social mobility. Despite the social needs that press us towards making better sense of 'the gap, ' we are, nevertheless, limited in our understanding of how race operates to affect Black students' educational experiences and outcomes. In Beyond Acting White we contend with one of the most oft cited explanations for Black underachievement; the notion that Blacks are culturally opposed to 'acting White' and, therefore, culturally opposed to succeeding in school. Our book uses the 'acting White' hypothesis as the point of departure in order to explore and evaluate how and under what conditions Black culture and identity are implicated in our understanding of why Black students continue to lag behind their White peers in educational achievement and attainment. Beyond Acting White provides a response to the growing call that we more precisely situate how race, its representations, intersectionalities, and context specific contingencies help us make better sense of the Black-White achievement gap.",Erin McNamara Horvat| Carla O,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xTdGyAJbPtwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Rowman & Littlefield,2006,Social Science

When the United States finally entered World War I, American artists and illustrators were commissioned to paint and draw it. These artists’ commissions, however, were as captains for their patron: the US Army. The eight men—William J. Aylward, Walter J. Duncan, Harvey T. Dunn, George M. Harding, Wallace Morgan, Ernest C. Peixotto, J. Andre Smith, and Harry E. Townsent—arrived in France early in 1918 with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF).

Twelve times an All-Star, Schmidt was perhaps baseball's premier power hitter during the 1970s and 1980s. His 548 home runs are seventh best all-time. In the field he was just as exceptional, winning ten Gold Gloves, more than any other third baseman besides Brooks Robinson. A three-time N.L.

In Raising Healthy Eaters, Dr. Legere offers 100 easy-to-follow and easy-to-implement tips for parents of children of all ages and eating preferences.

176147,Imperialism and Jewish Society: 200 B.C.E. to 640 C.E.,"This provocative new history of Palestinian Jewish society in antiquity marks the first comprehensive effort to gauge the effects of imperial domination on this people. Probing more than eight centuries of Persian, Greek, and Roman rule, Seth Schwartz reaches some startling conclusions--foremost among them that the Christianization of the Roman Empire generated the most fundamental features of medieval and modern Jewish life. Schwartz begins by arguing that the distinctiveness of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic, and early Roman periods was the product of generally prevailing imperial tolerance. From around 70 C.E. to the mid-fourth century, with failed revolts and the alluring cultural norms of the High Roman Empire, Judaism all but disintegrated. However, late in the Roman Empire, the Christianized state played a decisive role in ''re-Judaizing'' the Jews. The state gradually excluded them from society while supporting their leaders and recognizing their local communities. It was thus in Late Antiquity that the synagogue-centered community became prevalent among the Jews, that there re-emerged a distinctively Jewish art and literature--laying the foundations for Judaism as we know it today. Through masterful scholarship set in rich detail, this book challenges traditional views rooted in romantic notions about Jewish fortitude. Integrating material relics and literature while setting the Jews in their eastern Mediterranean context, it addresses the complex and varied consequences of imperialism on this vast period of Jewish history more ambitiously than ever before. Imperialism in Jewish Society will be widely read and much debated.",Seth Schwartz,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K13JHSSyH1gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2009-02-09,History

We learn that what we call ""modernity"" is simply a term for men sinning in the old ways with new toys and tools.

126854,Maryland's Vanishing Lives,"For more than two years, John Sherwood roamed Maryland's small towns and city neighborhoods, traveled Appalachian back roads, and sailed the Chesapeake looking for people whose work or way of life recalled the state's rich and varied tradition. Maryland's Vanishing Lives is his vivid account of the people he met on those journeys. Working in a country store or an old-time movie house, on a small tobacco farm or a weathered skipjack, Sherwood's subjects interest us as people, as stubborn survivors who have watched—sometimes defiantly, sometimes wistfully—as the world moved on. These Marylanders' stories poignantly show what happens to family businesses and ordinary folk in the face of new technology, suburban sprawl, franchise outlets, and changing tastes. But Maryland's Vanishing Lives is also an engaging celebration of pride and craft, and the ability to survive. In this collection of sixty-six short profiles, illustrated with memorable photographs by Edwin Remsberg, Sherwood preserves for posterity the lives of Marylanders who hang on to values and skills that are quickly disappearing.",John Sherwood,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mZi6h2nTl04C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,JHU Press,1995-10,History

A gripping literary thriller by the author of the “wrenching and exhilarating” All Things Cease to Appear (Wall Street Journal). Julian Ladd and Rye Adler cross paths as photography students in the exclusive Brodsky Workshop. When Rye needs a roommate, Julian moves in, and a quiet, compulsive envy takes root, assuring, at least in his own mind, that he will never achieve Rye’s certain success. Both men are fascinated with their beautiful and talented classmate, Magda, whose captivating images of her Polish neighborhood set her apart, and each will come to know her intimately – a woman neither can possess and only one can love. Twenty years later, long after their paths diverge, Rye is at the top of his field, famous for his photographs of celebrities and far removed from the downtrodden and disenfranchised subjects who’d secured his reputation as the eye of his generation. When Magda reenters his life, asking for help only he can give, Rye finds himself in a broken landscape of street people and addicts, forcing him to reckon with the artist he once was, until his search for a missing boy becomes his own desperate fight to survive. Months later, when Julian discovers Rye’s obituary, the paper makes it sound like a suicide. Despite himself, Julian attends the funeral, where there is no casket and no body. This sudden reentry into a world he thought he left behind forces Julian to question not only Rye’s death, but the very foundations of his life.

Modern communication techniques enable us to transmit and reconstitute images without needing to know a specific verbal sequence language such as the Morse code or Hungarian. International traffic signs use international image symbols which are not specific to any particular verbal language. An image language differs from a verbal one in that the latter uses a linear string of symbols, whereas the former is multi dimensional. Architectural renderings commonly show projections onto three mutual ly perpendicular planes, or consist of cross sections at different altitudes capa ble of being stacked and representing different floor plans. Such renderings make it difficult to imagine buildings comprising ramps and other features which disguise the separation between floors, and consequently limit the cre ative process of the architect. Analogously, we tend to analyze natural struc tures as if nature had used similar stacked renderings, rather than, for instance, a system of packed spheres, with the result that we fail to perceive the system of organization determining the form of such structures. Perception is a complex process. Our senses record; they are analogous to audio or video devices.

100890,Bosnia after Dayton: Nationalist Partition and International Intervention,"Since 1996, Bosnia & Herzegovina has been the site of a remarkable project of political engineering. A complex consortium of international agencies backed by Western governments have been transforming a devastated, ethnically partitioned, post-war territory into a multiethnic, democratic and economically viable state. Despite an enormous investment of personnel and resources, six years later BiHs post-Yugoslav future remains tenuous. Did the engineering project work? In an era when countries from Somalia to Afghanistan are confronting questions of state legitimacy amidst international intervention, Bosnia after Dayton is a fascinating study in the dilemmas of the post-Cold War international order. How effective are international peace-building interventions in fractured states? Is the preservation of a multinational state desirable--or even possible--where the majority of citizens only reluctantly acknowledge its legitimacy? Drawing on the authors extensive field experience, this book takes a hard look at the issues that Bosnia continues to face. Juxtaposing big-picture analysis with an intimate knowledge of the region, Bose situates the international community's extensive program of state-building and democratization in BiH since the Dayton Peace Agreement in `he context of Bosnia's and the former Yugoslavia's complex historical legacy of coexistence and conflict. Bose tells the gripping story of the divided city of Mostar, and analyzes the institutional structure and process of Dayton Bosnia. He dissects the making of the Dayton peace accords through American-led coercive diplomacy, and provides a constructive critique of international peace-building. A fascinating study of democratization in a divided society, this book promises to be a landmark in the literatures on former Yugoslavia, and international intervention.",Sumantra Bose,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O2nGNMKGYJsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press on Demand,2002,Political Science

42818,A Diary Between Friends,"On December 15, 2001 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien presented to the United States ambassador a special presentation copy of a sumptuous book commemorating the outpouring of sympathy, support, and assistance offered by Canadians to their American friends in the immediate aftermath of the terrible events of September 11. On February 2, 2002 McClelland & Stewart Ltd., together with the Government of Canada and exclusive sponsor Alliance Atlantis, offers this book to people on both sides of the border. This is a superbly designed, full-colour coffee-table book containing brilliant photographs of the events immediately following the appalling terrorist strikes and a selection of emotion-laden letters, articles, and messages reflecting the heartfelt responses of Canadians from Vancouver to St. John’s. The book is organized as a day-by-day chronicle. It shows in words and pictures what happened when hundreds of commercial airliners were unexpectedly grounded, stranding tens of thousands of people far from their homes. It shows the memorial services that were held everywhere, particularly on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where 100,000 people gathered. It shows the steps that Canadians took, both as individuals (for example, by assisting in the work at Ground Zero), and as a nation (by mobilizing our armed forces). It has been remarked that the events of September 11 have had a positive effect by bringing out the best in people. Nowhere is this more evident than in the manifest demonstrations of friendship between Canadians and Americans since that consequential day. This superb volume is both a memorial to those lost and a celebration of the spirit shared by the survivors on both sides of the border.",Canada| Alliance Atlantis (Firm),http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nEnoAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,McClelland & Stewart Limited,2002,Political Science

Books have been written about cosmetic ingredients, yet most people are not aware of the serious, harmful health effects of fragrance chemicals due to false advertising, failure to bear warning labels, and lack of media attention. Millions of people are disabled from repeated exposures to these deleterious products. Synthetic fragrances are ubiquitous in the U.S., and avoidance is nearly impossible unless a person remains housebound. Many people are under the false impression that perfumes are derived from flowers and other natural sources. Get A Whiff Of This will educate people and, therefore, give readers the knowledge they need in order to protect their health and the health of their loved ones.

139244,Subsidizing Capitalism: Brickmakers on the U.S.-Mexican Border (Suny Series in the Anthropology of Work),"Examines the economic activities of self-employed brickmakers and the unpaid family members and others who assist them in Mexico. In Mexico, self-employed brickmakers support capitalist enterprise by providing bricks to build hotels, factories, office buildings, and shopping malls at costs lower than those based on profit-making principles. Combining Chayanovian and neo-Marxist approaches, Subsidizing Capitalism asserts that the economic activities of these self-employed brickmakers may be considered counterhegemonic because they avoid proletarianization in the formal sector. Tamar Diana Wilson discusses the similarities between peasants and brickmakers, the structural position of garbage pickers in relation to brickmakers, the trajectory from piece worker to petty commodity producer to petty capitalist, the economic value of women’s and children’s work as part of the family labor force, and how the neopatriarchal household is intrinsic to petty commodity production. Interspersed throughout are short stories and poems that offer the brickmakers’ perspectives and provide a rarely seen look into their lives.

47984,On the Brink: The Great Lakes in the 21st Century,"Dave Dempsey weaves the natural character and phenomena of the Great Lakes and stories of the schemes, calamities, and unusual human residents of the Basin with the history of their environmental exploitation and recovery. Contrasting the incomparable beauty and complexity of the Lakes and the poetry, folklore, and citizen action they have inspired with the disasters that short-sighted human folly has inflicted on the ecosystem, Dempsey makes this history both engaging and relevant to today's debates and decisions.Underlying the neglectful treatment of the Lakes are two irreconcilable and faulty human assumptions: that the Lakes are a system so big that human beings cannot do it great harm, and that the Lakes are a resource that can be bent to the will of humankind. Dempsey finds evidence that, despite great changes in the laws governing the Lakes and public attitudes toward them in the last fifty years, government policy and institutions are still dominated by these dangerous attitudes.A central theme of On the Brinkis that citizens, who have displayed an increasing sense of commitment to the Lakes and a growing sense of place, must challenge their leaders to reform Great Lakes institutions. Dempsey shows that it is necessary to create a governing system that reflects the realities of life on the ground in communities and that taps into the passion and determination of citizens to protect these treasures.",Dave Dempsey,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nd7aAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,MSU Press,2004,History

106496,Knickerbocker's History of New York,"Told from the perspective of a cantankerous man named Deidrick Knickerbocker, A Knickerbocker’s History of New York depicts a satirical history spanning from the world’s creation to the end of the Dutch dynasty. Beginning with the start of time itself, Knickerbocker reveals historical anecdotes, both real and imagined featuring social commentary, fresh perspectives on the past, and conversations with powerful historical figures. With humor and intrigue, A Knickerbocker’s History of New York tells the tale of the discovery of New York, and explores the first Dutch settlements. While examining those origins, Knickerbocker muses about the ethics of colonization and the immoral treatment of Native Americans, with biting and brutal honesty. Still under the Dutch “rule”, 1600 New York acted as one of the breeding grounds for many American Christmas traditions, some of which are still alive today. Under a comical microscope, A Knickerbocker’s History of New York explores the effect the early Dutch settlements have on American culture, particularly in New York. Originally published in 1809, Washington Irving’s A Knickerbocker’s History of New York earned acclaim for its innovative genre as one of the first American comedic works. With the mix of specific, inside jokes and universal humor, Irving’s satire invites laughter from both his original audience and contemporary readers. With prose and wit that has remained fresh and hilarious even two-hundred and eleven years later, Washington Irving’s A Knickerbocker’s History of New York contains a narrative that has earned centuries of influence. While playfully mocking both classic literature and historians, Irving was bold enough to even include a list of people, professions and properties that he intended to make fun of. Though Irving mixes fact with fiction, A Knickerbocker’s History of New York provides useful insight on the history of Dutch Americans, as well as contributing thoughtful social commentary that finds itself still applicable to modern society. Now featuring a stunning new cover design and a modern font, this edition of Washington Irving’s A Knickerbocker’s History of New York is both accessible and entertaining.",Washington Irving,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ZosEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Graphic Arts Books,2021-01-05,Fiction

97155,"Just Here, Just Now: Poems","From the epigraph that opens this collection to the last lines of the final poem, Just Here, Just Now is a sustained meditation on the presence of spirit in the world of daily change and variety—the just here, just now. R. H. W. Dillard asserts that “time is precious,” not only because it is fleeting but because its particulars are precious in their holiness. Dillard’s concern is with the presence of the universal in the particular, or as he puts it in “Loading a Shoebox,” with “this day, / Another day like every day / Like no other.” Just Here, Just Now is as varied in its approaches to the spirit as it is in its poetic forms and subjects (which include serial murderers and the fall of the Soviet empire as well as personal memories of family, the death of a mother, and long letters to close friends). The collection moves from dark visions of love and loss in the first pages to meditations inspired by artists ranging from Henri Rousseau, Edgar Allan Poe, and Alfred Hitchcock to Thelonius Monk and Ornette Coleman. Many poems in the book’s later pages deal directly with issues of meaning and belief, resolving the problems of the earlier poems through discoveries of love’s presence even in loss and the mutable moment. As “Winter Letter to Bluefield” concludes: “It is true we lose the things we hold dearest / But equally true that because we hold them dear / We find ourselves which we otherwise had lost, / Find ourselves whole—just now, just here.”",R.

To stop her, the Allies turn to Professor Harry Winterbotham, an MI5 agent whose brilliance is matched only by his inscrutability. As Winterbotham hatches his own secret plan—one with the potential to deliver the world’s greatest weapon into the hands of the Nazis—the two spies play a deadly game of cat and mouse across the United States and Europe.

Then one day she witnessed the Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova, and her life was altered forever. Hypnotized by Pavlova’s beauty, in that moment de Mille dedicated herself to dance. Her memoir records with lighthearted humor and wisdom not only the difficulties she faced—the resistance of her parents, the sacrifices of her training—but also the frontier atmosphere of early Hollywood and New York and London during the Depression. “This is the story of an American dancer,” writes de Mille, “a spoiled egocentric wealthy girl, who learned with difficulty to become a worker, to set and meet standards, to brace a Victorian sensibility to contemporary roughhousing, and who, with happy good fortune, participated by the side of great colleagues in a renaissance of the most ancient and magical of all the arts.”",Agnes de Mille,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p2zXCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,New York Review of Books,2015-11-24,Biography & Autobiography

Now a mysterious wizard seeks to awaken the mad Tharn and unleash his terrifying power into the world. If he succeeds, the god’s insane fury could rip apart the fabric of existence and give the diabolical magician what he seeks most of all: the scepter of domination over the forces of chaos. Only the young scholar Calandryll has the knowledge and skill to stop the evil wizard’s plan. Accompanied by a cynical mercenary, protected by an enigmatic magic, he must journey across a war-torn countryside, facing terror and treachery both real and magical, to find the ancient book whose incantations can bring the evil god back to life — and destroy it forever.

164497,The Control of Nature,"While John McPhee was working on his previous book, Rising from the Plains, he happened to walk by the engineering building at the University of Wyoming, where words etched in limestone said: ""Strive on--the control of Nature is won, not given."" In the morning sunlight, that central phrase--""the control of nature""--seemed to sparkle with unintended ambiguity. Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions. For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about (in the words of the book itself) ""any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods."" His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control. In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches. The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation. At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is. In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away. It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port (accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy) but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast. As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history. On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example. McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers. Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world. After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow. Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons. At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris. Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.",John McPhee,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qQMFOctR7AoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2011-04-01,Nature

140073,The Miser and Other Plays,"Molière combined all the traditional elements of comedy - wit, slapstick, spectacle and satire - to create richly sophisticated and enduringly popular dramas. The Miser is the story of Harpagon, a mean-spirited old man who becomes obsessed with making money out of the marriage of his children, while The Hypochondriac, another study in obsession, is a brilliant satire on the medical profession. The School for Wives, in which an ageing domestic tyrant is foiled in his plans to marry his young ward, provoked such an outcry that Molière followed it with The School for Wives Criticized - a witty retort to those who disapproved of the play's supposed immorality. And while Don Juan is the darkest and most tragic of all the plays in this collection, it still mocks the soullessness of the skinflint with scathing irony.",Jean-Baptiste Moliere,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M28e2oaPhsYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Penguin UK,2004-05-27,Drama

In his fortieth year, Chris Offutt returns to his alma mater, Morehead State University, the only four-year school in the Kentucky hills. He envisions leading the modest life of a teacher and father. Yet present-day reality collides painfully with memory, leaving Offutt in the midst of an adventure he never imagined: the search for a home that no longer exists. Interwoven with this bittersweet homecoming tale are the wartime stories of Offutt’s parents-in-law, Arthur and Irene. An unlikely friendship develops between the eighty-year-old Polish Jew and the forty-year-old Kentucky hillbilly as Arthur and Offutt share comfort in exile, reliving the past at a distance.

In the 1630s, visitors to the prosperous trading cities of the Netherlands couldn't help but notice that thousands of normally sober, hardworking Dutch citizens were caught up in an extraordinary frenzy of buying and selling. The object of this unprecedented speculation was the tulip, a delicate and exotic Eastern import that had bewitched horticulturists, noblemen, and tavern owners alike. For almost a year rare bulbs changed hands for incredible and ever-increasing sums, until single flowers were being sold for more than the cost of a house. Historians would come to call it tulipomania. It was the first futures market in history, and like so many of the ones that would follow, it crashed spectacularly, plunging speculators and investors into economic ruin and despair. This colorful cast of characters includes Turkish sultans, Yugoslav soldiers, French botanists, and Dutch tavern keepers—all centuries apart historically and worlds apart culturally, but with one thing in common: tulipomania.",Mike Dash,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=piXqsiQ4h1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Crown,2010-02-10,Business & Economics

In this book, an eminent Jungian analyst examines the recurring motifs that appear in creation myths from around the world and shows what they teach us about the mysteries of creativity, the cycles of renewal in human life, and the birth of consciousness in the individual psyche. Among the topics discussed are: • Why the creative process is often accompanied by anxiety, depression, loneliness, and fear of the unknown. • The meaning of creation motifs such as the egg, the seed, the primordial being, the creative fire, the separation of heaven and earth, and the four stages of creation. • Creation symbolism in the alchemical opus of medieval tradition. • How creation-myth motifs appear in the dreams of people who are on the verge of a leap forward in consciousness.",Marie-Louise von Franz,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XkhEDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Shambhala Publications,2017-05-09,Psychology
24701,Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream,"For decades, Logsdon and his family have run a viable family farm. Along the way, he has become a widely influential journalist and social critic, documenting in hundreds of essays for national and regional magazines the crisis in conventional agri-business and the boundless potential for new forms of farming that reconcile tradition with ecology. Logsdon reminds us that healthy and economical agriculture must work ""at nature's pace,"" instead of trying to impose an industrial order on the natural world. Foreseeing a future with ""more farmers, not fewer,"" he looks for workable models among the Amish, among his lifelong neighbors in Ohio, and among resourceful urban gardeners and a new generation of defiantly unorthodox organic growers creating an innovative farmers-market economy in every region of the country. Nature knows how to grow plants and raise animals; it is human beings who are in danger of losing this age-old expertise, substituting chemical additives and artificial technologies for the traditional virtues of fertility, artistry, and knowledge of natural processes. This new edition of Logsdon's important collection of essays and articles (first published by Pantheon in 1993) contains six new chapters taking stock of American farm life at this turn of the century.",Gene Logsdon,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ja_NAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Chelsea Green Publishing,2000-02-01,Nature

158792,Living & Working in France 2005: A Survival Handbook (Living and Working in France),"Reimagining the scholarly book as living and collaborative--not as commodified and essentialized, but in all its dynamic materiality. In this book, Janneke Adema proposes that we reimagine the scholarly book as a living and collaborative project--not as linear, bound, and fixed, but as fluid, remixed, and liquid, a space for experimentation. She presents a series of cutting-edge experiments in arts and humanities book publishing, showcasing the radical new forms that book-based scholarly work might take in the digital age. Adema's proposed alternative futures for the scholarly book go beyond such print-based assumptions as fixity, stability, the single author, originality, and copyright, reaching instead for a dynamic and emergent materiality. Adema suggests ways to unbind the book, describing experiments in scholarly book publishing with new forms of anonymous collaborative authorship, radical open access publishing, and processual, living, and remixed publications, among other practices. She doesn't cast digital as the solution and print as the problem; the problem in scholarly publishing, she argues, is not print itself, but the way print has been commodified and essentialized. Adema explores alternative, more ethical models of authorship; constructs an alternative genealogy of openness; and examines opportunities for intervention in current cultures of knowledge production. Finally, asking why it is that we cut and bind our research together at all, she examines two book publishing projects that experiment with remix and reuse and try to rethink and reperform the book-apparatus by taking responsibility for the cuts they make.",Janneke Adema,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g_gLEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,MIT Press,2021-08-31,Language Arts & Disciplines

For Christian parents, there is no greater joy than seeing their children learn to walk with the Lord. And there is no greater fear than that their children will walk away from God. After serving together in pastoral ministry and raising their now-grown children, Phil and Diane Comer know those hopes and fears well. Like all new parents, they were intimidated and unsure about how to take on the task of spiritually training their young children. But now, with all four of their children grown and establishing their own households of faith, Phil and Diane have embarked on a quest to help the next generation of parents raise passionate Jesus followers. Drawing on years of pastoral counseling, teaching, leading, and decades of watching families from the perspective of pastors and leaders in ministry, Phil and Diane instruct, guide, encourage, and offer hope and practical help to Christian parents. Raising Passionate Jesus Followers is a manual full of practical, biblically based, and time-tested guidelines that parents will be able to turn to again and again through every stage of their children's development, including . . .

59709,FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.,"The extraordinary drama of Malta's WWII victory against impossible odds told through the eyes of the people who were there. In March and April 1942, more explosives were dropped on the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta - smaller than the Isle of Wight - than on the whole of Britain during the first year of the Blitz. Malta had become one of the most strategically important places in the world. From there, the Allies could attack Axis supply lines to North Africa; without it, Rommel would be able to march unchecked into Egypt, Suez and the Middle East. For the Allies this would have been catastrophic. As Churchill said, Malta had to be held 'at all costs'. FORTRESS MALTA follows the story through the eyes of those who were there: young men such as twenty-year-old fighter pilot Raoul Daddo-Langlois, anti-aircraft gunner Ken Griffiths, American Art Roscoe and submariner Tubby Crawford - who served on the most successful Allied submarine of the Second World War; cabaret dancer-turned RAF plotter Christina Ratcliffe, and her lover, the brilliant and irrepressible reconnaissance pilot, Adrian Warburton. Their stories and others provide extraordinary first-hand accounts of heroism, resilience, love, and loss, highlighting one of the most remarkable stories of World War II.",James Holland,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=In85AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Weidenfeld & Nicolson,2013-01-31,History

102543,The Black Seasons,"A mosaic of memories from a childhood in the Warsaw Ghetto and a life in hiding on the other side of the wall When six-year-old Michal Glowinski first heard the adults around him speak of the ghetto, he understood only that the word was connected with moving-and conjured up a fantastical image of a many-storied carriage pulled through the streets by some umpteen horses. He was soon to learn that the ghetto was something else entirely. A half-century later, Glowinski, now an eminent Polish literary scholar, leads us haltingly into Nazi-occupied Poland. Scrupulously attentive to the distance between a child's experience and an adult's reflection, Glowinski revisits the images and episodes of his childhood: the emaciated violinist playing a Mendelssohn concerto on the ghetto streets; his game of chess with a Polish blackmailer threatening to deliver him to the Gestapo; and his eventual rescue by Catholic nuns in an impoverished, distant convent. In language at once spare and eloquent, Glowinski explores the horror of those years, the fragility of existence, and the fragmented nature of memory itself.",Michal Glowinski| Marci Shore,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqOlHAtZzfsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Northwestern University Press,2005,Biography & Autobiography

In this new paperback edition, which has been thoroughly revised to take into account recent scholarship of early cinema, Michael Chanan provides a fasciniating account of the rich and hitherto hidden history of the origins of film. Chanan demonstrates that the theory of `the persistence of vision', which led to the invention of moving pictures, has been superceded by modern scientific findings. In its place, he puts forward a theory of invention as a type of bricolage, and shows that cinematography was a product of the forces of nineteenth century capitalism. He discusses the wealth of influences, both popular and bourgeois, on the culture of early cinema, including diorama, the magic lantern, itinerant entertainers and music hall. He looks at the relationship between film and photography, and considers the nascent film business, the ways in which early cinema was received by its audiences and the developing aesthetics of cinema in its first fifteen years.",Michael Chanan,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NqGIAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2003-09-02,Social Science

By chronicling the emergence and influence of these movements, Pahl enhances our understanding of their effect upon both the American church and society. Pahl also explores how youth ministry has been transformed over the years and suggests ways that youth ministry must redirect its focus in the twenty-first century. The compelling stories and contributions of modern youth ministry remain invisible in the standard histories of Religion in America. Jon Pahl makes young people and their faith commitments visible as primary actors in portraits of four youth ministries. A skillful theologian and historian, Pahl analyzes the tension between purity"" keeping young people safe from a hostile culture"" and practices"" efforts to encourage young people in risks and responsibilities"" and allows the past to become present tense.

A child of the first kibbutz movement in British Palestine, he went on to lead Israel to victory in the 1948 War of Independence and to liberate Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War. Dayan was not only a soldier but a politician, an archaeologist, and a larger-than-life figure who helped shape the state of Israel. In My Father, His Daughter, Yaël Dayan, who herself served in the Israeli Parliament, shares an uncensored look into her father’s life and her own conflicted relationship with him. With poignancy and candor, Dayan creates a profound yet nuanced profile of her father. She relates his strong national pride, his boldness in dealing with other world leaders, and his troubles at home to his disintegrating marriage and multiple affairs.

82782,The Progressed Horoscope,"After seven years of investigation, Alan Leo abandoned the various methods advocated by the different schools of exoteric astrology and began adopting a system, based on his own study and experience, which was centered on what is known as the progressed horoscope. The progressed horoscope is based on the ""Day For A Year"" system of progressing the nativity, a system first employed by the ancient Arabian astrologers. If not the ideal system of prediction, claimed Leo, it is certainly the most simple and on the whole the most satisfactory astrology system ever put forward. This Cosimo Classic is a reprint of the First Edition, originally published in 1905. ALAN LEO (1860-1917) is often called ""the father of modern astrology."" He was born a Leo Sun with Virgo Rising, in Westminster, London and given the name William Frederick Allan. He taught himself astrology at the age of 28 and within a decade he was sole proprietor of the enormously successful Modern Astrology Publishing Company and its magazine, which eventually became known as Modern Astrology. His thirty books on the subject fostered a revival in legitimate astrology in the twentieth century.",Alan Leo,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GIMfmrFBBsgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"Cosimo, Inc.",2005-12-01,"Body, Mind & Spirit"

The poetic irony is not lost on Chief Superintendent Peter McGarr: one of the foremost experts on the works of James Joyce was slain on the so-called ""Murderers' Ground"" made famous in the author's magnum opus Ulysses. But the connection does not end there. And the deeper the intrepid McGarr digs, the more startling truths he uncovers about a victim's dark, licentious history, a list of suspects as vast and varied as the characters in a great novel ... and a motive for murder that can hide as easily in the pages of a classic book as in the twisted passions of a human heart.",Bartholomew Gill,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jfzHKPUcHWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,Fiction

A high school student when interned in 1942, Minoru Kiyota was so infuriated by his treatment during an FBI interrogation and by the denial of his request to leave the camp to pursue his education that he refused to affirm his loyalty as required of all internees. For this he was sent to Tule Lake Segregation Center in northern California - a holding pen for ""dangerous"" and ""disloyal"" individuals. While imprisoned there under deplorable conditions, Kiyota learned of a new law offering Japanese Americans the ""opportunity"" to renounce their U.S. citizenship. Although barely old enough to do so, Kiyota took this drastic step. Throughout his four long years of incarceration, he refused to resign himself to the injustices he witnessed and experienced. His story shares the fury and frustration aroused by gross violations of his rights as a U.S. citizen and shows how the painful years of internment determined the course of his life.",Minoru Kiyota,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I8wfFPtRskgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,University of Hawaii Press,1997-06-01,Biography & Autobiography

20853,Dancing Skeletons,"One of the most widely used ethnographies published in the last twenty years, this Margaret Mead Award winner has been used as required reading at more than 600 colleges and universities. This personal account by a biocultural anthropologist illuminates not-soon-forgotten messages involving the sobering aspects of fieldwork among malnourished children in West Africa. With nutritional anthropology at its core, Dancing Skeletons presents informal, engaging, and oftentimes dramatic stories that relate the author’s experiences conducting research on infant feeding and health in Mali. Through fascinating vignettes and honest, vivid descriptions, Dettwyler explores such diverse topics as ethnocentrism, culture shock, population control, breastfeeding, child care, the meaning of disability and child death in different cultures, female circumcision, women’s roles in patrilineal societies, the dangers of fieldwork, and facing emotionally draining realities. Readers will laugh and cry as they meet the author’s friends and informants, follow her through a series of encounters with both peri-urban and rural Bambara culture, and struggle with her as she attempts to reconcile her very different roles as objective ethnographer, subjective friend, and mother in the field. The 20th Anniversary Edition includes a 13-page “Q&A with the Author” in which Dettwyler responds to typical questions she has received individually from students who have been assigned Dancing Skeletons as well as audience questions at lectures on various campuses. The new 23-page “Update on Mali, 2013” chapter is a factual update about economic and health conditions in Mali as well as a brief summary of the recent political unrest.",Katherine A.

The only legitimate approach to dealing with childhood obesity, however, is one that stresses improved fitness rather than weight loss.

Prominent adepts of the Golden Dawn, whose members included W. B. Yeats and Aleister Crowley, preserved these traditions in manuscripts to be circulated among initiates of the Order. These documents, known as the Flying Rolls, reveal secrets of astral projection, clairvoyance, exorcism, alchemy, and other magical practices and occult philosophy. Many of the Flying Rolls escaped print and remained secret for some time, only slowly being tracked down over the years. Here, Francis King presents all the previously unpublished Flying Rolls. • Renowned occultist Francis King includes previously unpublished secret writings of the Golden Dawn in this important collection. • These are essential texts for practitioners of magical techniques, and of great interest to any student of Western occultism. • New edition of Astral Projection, Ritual Magic, and Alchemy",Francis King,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zPAuHQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,Destiny Books,1997-03-01,"Body, Mind & Spirit"

Why could the Japanese not get a bomber strike launched against the American carrier force before being attacked and destroyed by American dive bombers from the Enterprise and Yorktown? Although it is well known that the Japanese were unable to launch an immediate attack because their aircraft were in the process of changing armament, why wasn't the rearming operation reversed and an attack launched before the American planes arrived?

Decisions made during the early conceptual stages of design have a great effect on subsequent stages. In fact, quite often more than 70% of the manufacturing cost of a product is determined at this conceptual stage, yet manufacturing is not involved. Through this book, designers will gain insight that will allow them to assess the impact of their proposed design on manufacturing difficulty. The vast majority of components found in commercial batch-manufactured products, such as appliances, computers and office automation equipment are either injection molded, stamped, die cast, or (occasionally) forged. This book emphasizes these particular, most commonly implemented processes. In addition to chapters on these processes, the book touches upon material process selection, general guidelines for determining whether several components should be combined into a single component or not, communications, the physical and mechanical properties of materials, tolerances, and inspection and quality control. In developing the DFM methods presented in this book, he has worked with over 30 firms specializing in injection molding, die-casting, forging and stamping.

95760,"The problem of pain, (The Christian challenge series, ed. by Ashley Sampson)","C. S. Lewis, long renowned for his children's books as well as his Christian apologetics, has been the subject of wide interest since he first stepped-up to the BBC's microphone during the Second World War. Until now, however, the reasons why this medievalist began writing books for a popular audience, and why these books have continued to be so popular, had not been fully explored. In fact Lewis, who once described himself as by nature an 'extreme anarchist', was a critical controversialist in his time-and not to everyone's liking. Yet, somehow, Lewis's books directed at children and middlebrow Christians have continued to resonate in the decades since his death in 1963. Stephanie L. Derrick considers why this is the case, and why it is more true in America than in Lewis's home-country of Britain. The story of C. S. Lewis's fame is one that takes us from his childhood in Edwardian Belfast, to the height of international conflict during the 1940s, to the rapid expansion of the paperback market, and on to readers' experiences in the 1980s and 1990s, and, finally, to London in November 2013, where Lewis was honoured with a stone in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey. Derrick shows that, in fact, the author himself was only one actor among many shaping a multi-faceted image. The Fame of C. S. Lewis is the most comprehensive account of Lewis's popularity to date, drawing on a wealth of fresh material and with much to interest scholars and C. S. Lewis admirers alike.",Stephanie L.

197601,Raven's Bride,"In 1829, Sam Houston was the thirty-six-year-old governor of Tennessee, a “beautiful…imperious giant genius of a man,” whose political horizons seemed limitless. The marriage of this charismatic, ambitious statesman to twenty-year-old Eliza Allen, the daughter of a prominent landholder, seemed to form the perfect social foundation on which Houston would build his glittering career. But just eleven weeks after the wedding, Eliza suddenly and inexplicably left her new husband, creating a scandal that caused the governor to resign his office in disgrace and embark on an exile that would ultimately deliver him to Texas, and a destiny even grander and more improbable than anyone could have imagined. Through decades of rumor and speculation, Sam Houston and Eliza Allen never revealed the source of their unhappiness, and carried the secret with them to their graves. The Raven’s Bride is a brilliantly original novel that unravels this dark romantic mystery while illuminating a vivid and fascinating moment in America’s past. In these pages, Sam Houston is presented as he must have been—a heroic figure (called the Raven by the Cherokee), vain, flamboyant, magnetic, his outsized personality fueled by a desperate need for love. And Eliza Allen is his match: a prideful, magnificent young woman, both drawn to and disturbed by her husband’s grand aspirations. With the investigative acuity of a historian and the profound empathy of a gifted novelist, Elizabeth Crook has created an enthralling portrait of these star-crossed lovers and the vibrant, restless world that brought them together. Richly detailed and splendidly imagined, The Raven’s Bride turns a baffling historical conundrum into a complex and deeply affecting love story.",Elizabeth Crook,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RcIHAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Doubleday,2013-10-02,Fiction
19698,PARTIAL ECLIPSE,"""Have you ever seen a total solar eclipse?"" If the question caused you to search your memory, the correct answer would have been ""no."" A common response is: ""Yes--I saw one, it was about 90% partial eclipse where I lived."" A 90% partial eclipse is indeed a remarkable phenomenon, but true totality leaves all else in the shade, in all senses of the phrase. Ask the question of anyone who has experienced the full sensation of being obliterated by the moon's shadow, and they will reply ""yes""--without hesitation--and continue with a monologue describing the overwhelming experiences and unique phenomena that ensued. On 21 August 2017 millions of people across the United States witnessed ""The Great American Eclipse"" of the Sun. The moment it was over, people around the world were asking questions: what caused the weird shadows and colors in the build up to totality? Were those ephemeral bands of shadows gliding across the ground in the seconds before totality real or an optical illusion? Why this, what that, but above all: where and when can I see a total solar eclipse again? Eclipses: What Everyone Needs to Know helps explain the profound differences between a 99.99% partial eclipse and true totality, and inform readers how to experience this most beautiful natural phenomenon successfully. It covers eclipses of sun, moon, and other astronomical objects, and their applications in science, as well as their role in history, literature, and myth. It describes the phenomena to expect at a solar eclipse and the best ways to record them--by camera, video, or by simple handmade experiments. The book covers the timetable of upcoming eclipses, where the best locations will be to see them, and the opportunities for using them as vehicles for inspiration and education. As a veteran of seven total solar eclipses, physicist Frank Close is an expert both on the theory and practice of eclipses.

7964,Foundations of potential theory (Die Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften in Einzeldarstellungen mit besonderer Berucksichtigung der Anwendungsgebiete),"FOUNDATIONS OF POTENTIAL THEORY by OLIVER DIMON KELLOGG. Originally published in 1929. Preface: The present volume gives a systematic treatment of potential functions. It takes its origin in two courses, one elementary and one advanced, which the author has given at intervals during the last ten years, and has a two-fold purpose first, to serve as an introduction for students whose attainments in the Calculus include some knowledge of partial derivatives and multiple and line integrals and secondly, to provide the reader with the fundamentals of the subject, so that he may proceed immediately to the applications, or to - the periodical literature of the day. It is inherent in the nature of the subject that physical intuition and illustration be appealed to freely, and this has been done. However, in order that the ok may present sound ideals to the student, and also serve the ma pmatician, both for purposes of reference and as a basis for further developments, the proofs have been given by rigorous methods. This has led, at a number of points, to results either not found elsewhere, or not readily accessible. Thus, Chapter IV contains a proof for the general regular region of the divergence theorem Gauss, or Greens theorem on the reduction of volume to surface integrals. The treatment of the fundamental existence theorems in Chapter XI by means of integral equations meets squarely the difficulties incident to the discontinuity of the kernel, and the same chapter gives an account of the most recent developments with respect to the Pirichlet problem. Exercises are introduced in the conviction that no mastery of a mathematical subject is possible without working with it. They are designed primarily to illustrate or extend the theory, although the desirability of requiring an occasional concrete numerical result has not been lost sight of. O. D. Kellogg. August, 1929.

161696,Suspicion and Faith: The Religious Uses of Modern Atheism,"Marx, Nietzche, and Freud are among the most influential of modern atheists. The distinctive feature of their challenge to theistic and specifically Christian belief is expressed by Paul Ricoeur when he calls them the ""masters of suspicion."" While skepticism directs its critique to the truth or evidential basis of belief, suspicion asks two different, intimately intertwined questions: what are the motives that lead to this belief? and what function does it play, what work does it do for the individuals and communities that adopt it. What suspicion suspects is that the survival value of religious beliefs depends on satisfying desires and interests that the believing soul and the believing community are not eager to acknowledge because they violate the values they profess, as when, for example, talk about justice is a mask for deep-seated resentment and the desire for revenge. For this reason, the hermeneutics of suspicion is a theory, or group of theories, of self-deception: ideology critique in Marx, genealogy in Nietzsche, and psychoanalysis in Freud. Suspicion and Faith argues that the appropriate religious response (""the religious uses of modern atheism"") to these critiques is not to try to refute or deflect them, but rather to acknowledge their force in a process of self-examination--and this for two reasons. First, while these critiques are not, as Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud tend to suppose.",Merold Westphal,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w4ukywEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,Fordham Univ Press,1998,Philosophy

Its main assumption is that traders' juridical, economic, political and unofficial standing can only be viewed correctly through the lens of the polis framework. It argues that those engaging in inter-regional trade with classical Athens were mainly poor and foreign (hence politically inert at Athens). Moreover, Athens, as well as other classical Greek poleis, resorted to limited measures, well short of war or other modes of economic imperialism, to attract them. However, at least in the minds of individual Athenians considerations of traders' indispensability to Athens displaced what otherwise would have been low estimations of their social status.",C. M.

78223,No Fixed Abode: A Jewish Odyssey to Africa,"In this memoir, Fraenkel writes as a member of an enclosed minority: German Jew within a predominantly Lithuanian Jewish community which was part of a white settler community, itself a minority in a predominantly black African territory. A young settler reprimanded him for stepping out of the way of an African family on a narrow bush path: “Walk straight on. They must know who is the master in the land.” Fraenkel found himself whistling the Nazis’ anthem “Clear the streets for the brown battalions. The storm troopers are marching.” He was coming to learn the importance of not conforming. “A vivid account of a childhood in a middleclass, non-observant Jewish family in Nazi Germany, forced to emigrate to Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) in 1939.” — Trevor Gundry, Jewish Chronicle “Peter Fraenkel... and his family emigrated in 1939 from Breslau to Northern Rhodesia, where he forged a successful career... in the Central African Broadcasting Service. Fraenkel was thus given the opportunity of using his undoubted skills as a broadcaster to help in the education of black people, using new methods of mass education... his sojourn in Northern Rhodesia came to an end in 1957, a few years after the country was refashioned by the British government as the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland — a big mistake, Fraenkel thinks, and one that wasn’t undone until much later when the independent state of Zambia was created. His love affair with Africa came to an end, and he felt impelled to leave, because of his ‘dislike of racist politics in this bastion of white privilege’... Peter Fraenkel’s account of the 20 years in Northern Rhodesia is absorbing... there are riveting chapters on his activities as a somewhat subversive broadcaster, working together with like-minded whites and Blacks... The book is written in a very lively manner and there are countless anecdotes, many of them in direct speech... I recommend it strongly.” — Leslie Baruch Brent, Association of Jewish Refugees “The book bursts with life. Countries like these Central African territories are... far more exciting than countries with a settled structure. Here a new society is emerging. This excitement is lost in official reports and academic studies and one of Fraenkel’s achievements is that he conveys it in full measure. I know of no book which more vividly describes the variety and throb of a modern African township.” — Max Gluckman, The Observer “He brings out the formation of the new African metropolitan and rural societies...

166596,"Enhanced Ethnographic Methods: Audiovisual Techniques, Focused Group Interviews, and Elicitation (Ethnographer's Toolkit)","In addition to the traditional use of participant observation, interviews, and surveys, qualitative researchers have developed a variety of other methods to obtain information in their studies. Visual data from film and still photographs are now supplemented with video and computer techniques and are used in many settings. Focused group interviews, once in the domain of market researchers, are now regularly used by qualitative researchers as well. Elicitation techniques, such as triads, pile sorts, and freelists, originally developed by cognitive anthropologists have been widely adopted to help understand the inner workings of the members of a group. In this brief volume, these three sets of methods are explained in simple, practical language. The authors describe when and how to use these sets of techniques for community research, market research, and formative evaluation and other health, social welfare, and educational settings both domestically and internationally.",Margaret D.

131750,"Caesar and Cleopatra,","Exclusive to Penguin Classics: the definitive text of one of Shakespeare’s most affecting plays—part of the official Bernard Shaw Library A Penguin Classic In a cheeky nod to Shakespeare’s towering reputation, Shaw reinvents two of his historical characters but sets his own play in a period predating both Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra. Shaw’s Cleopatra is a kittenish girl with a streak of cruelty, while his Caesar is a world-weary philosopher-soldier who is as much a stranger in Rome as in the barbaric court of Egypt. With wit, irony, and an undertone of melancholy, Caesar and Cleopatra satirizes Shakespeare’s use of history and comments wryly on the politics of Shaw’s own time. This is the definitive text prepared under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence. The volume includes Shaw’s preface of 1900.",George Bernard Shaw| Dan H.

It is essentially a novel of ideas expressed in the birth, life, and early death of Oliver Alden. In Oliver's case the puritanical self-destruction that prevented him from realizing his own spirituality is transcended by his attainment of the type of self-knowledge that Santayana recommends throughout his moral philosophy. The Last Puritan is volume four in a new critical edition of George Santayana's wroks that restores Santayana's original text and provides important new scholarly information. Books in this series - the first complete publication of Santayana's works - include an editorial apparatus with notes to the text (identifying persons, places, and ideas), textual commentary (including a description of the composition and publication history, along with a discussion of editorial methods and decisions), lists of variants and emendations, and line-end hyphenations.",George Santayana,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Tb9CwgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,Macmillan Reference USA,1981-02,Fiction

Not hardship, not isolation, not even her own loneliness posed the greatest threat; it was the land itself that took away both love and livelihood. Robley Wilson's The World Still Melting tells the story of the Toblers and their friends Harvey and Nancy Riker, whose abusive marriage ultimately costs the Toblers their happiness, and Burton Stone, the man in the middle, whose affair with Nancy is the literal trigger of the novel's action. Good and evil play out on these three family farms, whose very existence is a vanishing part of a heartland giving way to corporate avarice. The Iowa of Wilson's novel is a place where keeping land and home has become a dehumanizing territorial battle, and where small farmers like Paul, Harvey, and Burton face the whims of governments, banks, and weather that bring drought one year and deluge the next. Writing with great compassion, honesty, and remarkable skill, Wilson shows here what happens to real people in a hard place, where the traditional world is slowly but steadily melting away.",Robley Wilson,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cbb0wAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,Thomas Dunne Books,2005-02-01,Fiction

188427,"The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant, Volume 23: February 1 - December 31, 1872","Notified of his nomination for a second term in June 1872, Ulysses S. Grant accepted, promising ""the same zeal and devotion to the good of the whole people for the future of my official life, as shown in the past."" Challenged by a coalition of disaffected Republicans and Democrats led by New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley, Grant was privately optimistic about his own chances. ""There has been no time from the Baltimore Convention to this when I have felt the least anxiety. The Soreheads & thieves who have deserted the republican party have strengthened it by their departure."" Despite his confidence, Grant found it difficult to ignore attacks against him?attacks that prudence prevented him from answering directly. He found vindication, however, on election day, when he carried all but six states. When Greeley died soon afterward, Grant set aside any bitterness and joined mourners at the New York City funeral. Among the policies that voters tacitly endorsed were Grant's continuing efforts to quell violence in the South, which achieved some success during 1872. He sought as before to support and encourage embattled Southern Republicans, hoping eventually to replace military protection with political legitimacy. On the subject of civil rights, he repeated his desire that blacks receive equal treatment in everyday life, telling a delegation that ""a ticket on a railroad or other conveyance should entitle you to all that it does other men."" Grant also maintained a steady course toward Indians, defending his peace policy when many clamored for harsher measures. ""I do not believe our Creator ever placed different races of men on this earth with the view of having the stronger exert all his energies in exterminating the weaker."" Protestant and Catholic missionaries and laymen continued to spread the twin gospels of religion and civilization among the various tribes. When a Sioux delegation visited the White House, Grant spoke of the future when ""the game will be gone"" and of his hope that the Sioux would join other tribes and move to Indian Territory. ""We would at first build houses for your chiefs and principal men, and . . . send you large herds of cattle and sheep to live upon."" Grant's foreign policy in 1872 centered on the Geneva tribunal, established the previous year to arbitrate the thorny dispute with Great Britain over the Alabama Claims. At stake were both the responsibility for past damages and future rules for neutral countries. Grant and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish debated long over the men best suited to present the United States' case. When the tribunal awarded $15.5 million to the United States, Grant and Fish celebrated their greatest foreign policy achievement. Several minor scandals clouded the horizon in 1872, most notably at the New York City customhouse, where influence peddling by former staff aide George K. Leet came under congressional scrutin",Ulysses Simpson Grant,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nywmdo_OyoMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,SIU Press,2000,Biography & Autobiography
